This program is designed to scrape all play by play data from websites with format like Wayland's
I have only tested this code on linux, it may require some changes on other operating systems

Install the source code into a directory. 
I suggest creating a virtual environment in which you install all the dependencies
Run '''pip3 install -r requirements.txt'''

Usage


Replace url_part_1 and url_part_2 in config.py with the appropriate website
Run '''python3 overall_scraper.py'''
Wait
